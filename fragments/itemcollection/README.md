# STAC API - ItemCollection Fragment

This document explains the structure and content of a SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) ItemCollection. 
An **ItemCollection** is a [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) [FeatureCollection](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.3) 
that is augmented with [foreign members](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-6) relevant to a STAC entity.

Similarly to the relationship between a GeoJSON Feature and a STAC Item, a STAC ItemCollection should be a valid GeoJSON 
FeatureCollection to allow interoperability with existing tools that support GeoJSON. 

Item objects are represented in JSON format and are very flexible. Any JSON object that contains all the
required fields is a valid STAC ItemCollection.

- Examples:
  - See the [minimal example](examples/itemcollection-sample-minimal.json), as well as a [more complete 
    example](examples/itemcollection-sample-full.json). There are more real world inspired samples in the [examples/](examples/) folder.
- [OpenAPI YAML](openapi.yaml)

## ItemCollection fields

This object describes a STAC ItemCollection. The fields `type` and `features` are inherited from GeoJSON FeatureCollection.

| Field Name      | Type                                    | Description |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| stac_version    | string                                  | **REQUIRED.** The STAC version the ItemCollection implements. |
| stac_extensions | \[string\]                                | A list of extensions the ItemCollection implements. |
| type            | string                                  | **REQUIRED.** Always "FeatureCollection" to provide compatibility with GeoJSON. |
| features        | [STAC Item](../../stac-spec/item-spec/item-spec.md)               | **REQUIRED** A possibly-empty array of Item objects. |
| links           | [Link Object](../../stac-spec/item-spec/item-spec.md#link-object) | An array of Links related to this ItemCollection. |

**stac_version**: In general, STAC versions can be mixed, but please keep the [recommended best 
practices](../../stac-spec/best-practices.md#mixing-stac-versions) in mind.

**stac_extensions**: A list of STAC content extensions the ItemCollection implements. The list contains URLs to the JSON Schema files it 
can be validated against. For official [STAC extensions](https://stac-extensions.github.io/#list-of-stac-extensions), a "shortcut"
can be used. This means you can specify the folder name of the extension, for example `single-file-stac` for the Single File 
STAC extension. This does *not* apply for [API extensions](../../extensions.md). If the versions of the extension and the item diverge, 
you can specify the URL of the JSON schema file. This list must only contain extensions that extend the ItemCollection itself, see the 
the 'Scope' column in the list of extensions. It must not contain extensions that extend the Item objects, these must be specified in the 
Item object directly.

## Extensions

- The [Context Extension](../../item-search/README.md#context) adds additional fields to STAC ItemCollection relevant 
  to their use as search results.
- The [Single File STAC Extension](https://github.com/stac-extensions/single-file-stac/blob/main/README.md) provides a set of Collection 
  and Item objects as a single file catalog.
