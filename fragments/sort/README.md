# STAC API - Sort Fragment

- **OpenAPI specification:** [openapi.yaml](openapi.yaml)
- **Conformance Class:** 
  - Item Search binding: <https://api.stacspec.org/v1.0.0-beta.5/item-search#sort>
  - STAC Features binding: <https://api.stacspec.org/v1.0.0-beta.5/ogcapi-features#sort>
- **Fragment [Maturity Classification](../../extensions.md#extension-maturity):** Pilot
- **Dependents:**
  - [Item Search](../../item-search)
  - [STAC Features](../../ogcapi-features)
 
This defines a new parameter, `sortby`, that allows the user to define fields by which to sort results. 
Only string, numeric, and datetime attributes of Item (`id` and `collection` only) or Item Properties (any attributes) 
may be used to sort results.  It is not required that implementations support sorting over all attributes, but 
implementations should return an error when attempting to sort over a field that does not support sorting. 

This fragment may be bound to either or both of 
[Item Search](../../item-search) (`/search` endpoint) or
[STAC Features](../../ogcapi-features) (`/collections/{collection_id}/items` endpoint) by
advertising the relevant conformance class. 

Fields may be sorted in ascending or descending order.  The syntax between GET requests and POST requests with a JSON 
body vary.  The `sortby` value is an array, so multiple sort fields can be defined which will be used to sort 
the data in the order provided (e.g., first by `datetime`, then by `eo:cloud_cover`).

**NOTE**: *This fragment may change, as our goal is to align with OGC API functionality, and sorting is currently being 
worked on as part of OGC API - Records, see [this issue](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-records/issues/22) 
for the latest discussion.*

## HTTP GET (or POST Form)

When calling a relevant endpoint using GET (or POST with `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or 
`Content-Type: multipart/form-data)`, a single parameter `sortby` with a comma-separated list of item field names must 
be provided. The field names may be prefixed with either "+" for ascending, or "-" for descending.  If no sign is 
provided before the field name, it will be assumed to be "+". 

Examples of `sortby` parameter:

1. `GET /search?sortby=properties.created`
2. `GET /search?sortby=+properties.created`
3. `GET /search?sortby=properties.created,-id`
4. `GET /search?sortby=+properties.created,-id`
5. `GET /search?sortby=-properties.eo:cloud_cover`
    
Note that examples 1 and 2 are symantically equivalent, as well as examples 3 and 4.

## HTTP POST JSON Entity

When calling the relevant endpoint using POST with`Content-Type: application/json`, this adds an attribute `sortby` with 
an object value to the core JSON search request body.

The syntax for the `sortby` attribute is:

```json
{
    "sortby": [
        {
            "field": "<property_name>",
            "direction": "<direction>"
        }
    ]
}
```

```json
{
    "sortby": [
        {
            "field": "properties.created",
            "direction": "asc"
        },
        {
            "field": "properties.eo:cloud_cover",
            "direction": "desc"
        },
        {
            "field": "id",
            "direction": "desc"
        },
        {
            "field": "collection",
            "direction": "desc"
        }
    ]
}
```
