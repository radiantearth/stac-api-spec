            Summaries are either a unique set of all available values *or*
            statistics. Statistics by default only specify the range (minimum
            and maximum values), but can optionally be accompanied by additional
            statistical values. The range can specify the potential range of
            values, but it is recommended to be as precise as possible. The set
            of values must contain at least one element and it is strongly
            recommended to list all values. It is recommended to list as many
            properties as reasonable so that consumers get a full overview of
            the Collection. Properties that are covered by the Collection
            specification (e.g. `providers` and `license`) may not be repeated
            in the summaries.

                  be specified. Ranges can be specified for ordinal values only,
                  which means they need to have a rank order. Therefore, ranges
                  can only be specified for numbers and some special types of
                  strings. Examples: grades (A to F), dates or times.
                  Implementors are free to add other derived statistical values
                  to the object, for example `mean` or `stddev`.

                  Each bounding box is provided as four or six numbers, depending on
                  whether the coordinate reference system includes a vertical axis
                  (height or depth):

                  * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1
                  * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 2
                  * Minimum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)
                  * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 1
                  * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2
                  * Maximum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)

                  The coordinate reference system of the values is WGS 84 longitude/latitude
                  (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84) unless a different coordinate
                  reference system is specified in `crs`.

                  For WGS 84 longitude/latitude the values are in most cases the sequence of
                  minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude and maximum latitude.
                  However, in cases where the box spans the antimeridian the first value
                  (west-most box edge) is larger than the third value (east-most box edge).

                  If the vertical axis is included, the third and the sixth number are
                  the bottom and the top of the 3-dimensional bounding box.

                  If a feature has multiple spatial geometry properties, it is the decision of the
                  server whether only a single spatial geometry property is used to determine
                  the extent or all relevant geometries.

            This is only valid when the server is responding to POST request.

            If merge is true, the client is expected to merge the body value

            This avoids passing large post bodies back and forth when following
            links, particularly for navigating pages through the `POST /search`
            endpoint.

            NOTE: To support form encoding it is expected that a client be able
            to merge in the key value pairs specified as JSON
            `{"next": "token"}` will become `&next=token`.

        `proprietary` if the license is not on the SPDX license list or
        `various` if multiple licenses apply. In these two cases links to the
        license texts SHOULD be added, see the `license` link relation type.

        Non-SPDX licenses SHOULD add a link to the license text with the
        `license` relation in the links section. The license text MUST NOT be
        provided as a value of this field. If there is no public license URL
        available, it is RECOMMENDED to host the license text and
        link to it.

              The provider's role(s) can be one or more of the following
              elements:

              * licensor: The organization that is licensing the dataset under
                the license specified in the collection's license field.
              * producer: The producer of the data is the provider that
                initially captured and processed the source data, e.g. ESA for
                Sentinel-2 data.
              * processor: A processor is any provider who processed data to a
                derived product.
              * host: The host is the actual provider offering the data on their
                storage. There should be no more than one host, specified as last
                element of the list.

    bbox:
      description: |-
        Only features that have a geometry that intersects the bounding box are
        selected. The bounding box is provided as four or six numbers,
        depending on whether the coordinate reference system includes a
        vertical axis (elevation or depth):

        * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1
        * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 2  
        * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 3 (optional) 
        * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 1 
        * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2 
        * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 3 (optional)

        The coordinate reference system of the values is WGS84
        longitude/latitude (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84).

        For WGS84 longitude/latitude the values are in most cases the sequence
        of minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude and maximum
        latitude. However, in cases where the box spans the antimeridian the
        first value (west-most box edge) is larger than the third value
        (east-most box edge).

        If a feature has multiple spatial geometry properties, it is the
        decision of the server whether only a single spatial geometry property
        is used to determine the extent or all relevant geometries.

        Example: The bounding box of the New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone in
        WGS 84 (from 160.6°E to 170°W and from 55.95°S to 25.89°S) would be
        represented in JSON as `[160.6, -55.95, -170, -25.89]` and in a query as
        `bbox=160.6,-55.95,-170,-25.89`.
