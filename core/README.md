The base of a STAC API is its landing page. This resource is the starting point to discover what behaviors 
the API supports via the `conformsTo` values and link relations. 
This behavior in a RESTful API is known as 
[Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS). 
STAC API relies heavily on hypermedia for API resource navigation. 

There are a few requirements for the returned document:

- The returned JSON must be a valid [STAC Catalog](../stac-spec/catalog-spec/catalog-spec.md), and it can provide any number of 'child' links
to navigate down to additional Catalog, [Collection](../stac-spec/collection-spec/README.md), and [Item](../stac-spec/item-spec/README.md) objects.
- The `links` section is a required part of STAC Catalog, and serves as the list of API endpoints. These can live at any location, the 
client must inspect the the `rel` (relationship) to understand what capabilities are offered at each location.
- The `conformsTo` section must provide the capabilities of this service. This is the field
  that indicates to clients that this is a STAC API and how to access conformance classes, including this
  one. The relevant conformance URI's are listed in each part of the
  API specification. If a conformance URI is listed then the service must implement all of the required capabilities.

Note the `conformsTo` JSON object follows exactly the structure of OGC API - Features [declaration of conformance 
classes](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html#_declaration_of_conformance_classes), except is available directly under 
the landing page. This is a slight break from how OGC API does things, as STAC feels it is important for clients to be able to understand
conformance in a single request. Implementers choosing to also implement the OGC API - Features and/or 
STAC API - Features conformance classes must also implment the `/conformance` endpoint.

This particular catalog provides the ability to browse down to child STAC Collection objects through its `child` links, and also provides the search
endpoint to be able to search across items in its collections. Note though that none of those links are required, other servers may provide
different conformance classes and a different set of links. 

The only requirements of the STAC API core class are to provide a valid STAC Catalog that includes a valid `conformsTo` JSON object
in it. Any API implementing that is considered a valid STAC API, and clients can inspect the document to figure out what other
capabilities are on offer and how to reach them.

The root endpoint (`/`) is most useful when it presents a complete `Catalog` representation of all the data contained in the API, such 
that all `Collection` and `Item` objects can be navigated to by transitively traversing links from this root. This spec does not require any 
API endpoints from OAFeat or STAC API to be implemented, so the following links may not exist if the endpoint has not been implemented.

## Link Relations

The following Link relations shall exist in the Landing Page (root).

| **rel**        | **href** | **From**  | **Description**                                      |
| -------------- | -------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `root`         | `/`      | STAC Core | The root URI                                         |
| `self`         | `/`      | OAFeat    | Self reference, same as root URI                     |
| `service-desc` | `/api`   | OAFeat    | The service description in a machine-readable format |

The path for the `service-desc` endpoint is recommended to be `/api`, but may be another path. Recommended to be
OpenAPI 3.0 or 3.1 with media types `application/vnd.oai.openapi` (YAML),
`application/vnd.oai.openapi+json;version=3.0` (3.0 JSON), or `application/vnd.oai.openapi+json;version=3.1`
(3.1 JSON).

A `service-doc` endpoint is recommended, but not required. This commonly returns an HTML
page, for example, in the form of [Redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc) interactive API
, but any format is allowed. The Link `type` field should correspond to whatever format or formats are
supported by this endpoint, e.g., `text/html`.

| **rel**       | **href**    | **From** | **Description**                                                                                                                    |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `service-doc` | `/api.html` | OAFeat   | A human-consumable service description. The path for this endpoint is only recommended to be `/api.html`, but may be another path. |

Additionally, `child` relations may exist to individual catalogs and collections.

| **rel** | **href** | **From**  | **Description**                                                                                          |
| ------- | -------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `child` | various  | STAC Core | The child STAC Catalogs & Collections. Provides curated paths to get to STAC Collection and Item objects |

It is also valid to have `item` links from the landing page, but most STAC API services are used to 
serve up a large number of features, so they typically
use several layers of intermediate `child` links before getting to Item objects.  Note that the `items` (plural)
link relation is used by APIs implementing `STAC API - Features` to link from a Collection to the items in that collection.

## Endpoints

This conformance class also requires for the endpoints in the [STAC API - Core](../core) conformance class to be implemented.

These endpoints are required, with details provided in this [OpenAPI specification document](openapi.yaml).

| Endpoint | Returns                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/`      | [Catalog](../stac-spec/catalog-spec/README.md) | Landing page, links to API capabilities                                                                                                                            |
| `/api`   | any                                            | The service description of the service from the `service-desc` link `rel`. The path is only recommended to be `/api`, and is at the discretion of the implementer. |

The service description endpoint may return any specification format. It is recommended to use OpenAPI 3.0 or 3.1
with media types `application/vnd.oai.openapi` (YAML), `application/vnd.oai.openapi+json;version=3.0` (3.0 JSON),
or `application/vnd.oai.openapi+json;version=3.1` (3.1 JSON). Whichever format or formats are used, the link
with relation `service-desc` must have a `type` field that matches an `Accept` header value to which the service
responds, and the `Content-Type` header in the response should contain the same media type. If the OpenAPI 3.0
format is used, the conformance class `http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-features-1/1.0/conf/oas30` should be
advertised. All service descriptions provided as part of the STAC API spec use OpenAPI 3.0 YAML format, and can
easily be used to return either YAML or JSON from this endpoint. OAFeat does not currently define a conformance
class for OpenAPI 3.1, but may in the future. 

## Example Landing Page for STAC API - Core

This JSON is what would be expected from an api that only implements STAC API - Core. In practice, 
most APIs will also implement other conformance classes, and those will be reflected in the `links` and 
`conformsTo` fields.  A more typical Landing Page example is in 
the [overview](../overview.md#example-landing-page) document.

```json
{
    "stac_version": "1.0.0",
    "id": "example-stac",
    "title": "A simple STAC API Example",
    "description": "This Catalog aims to demonstrate the a simple landing page",
    "type": "Catalog",
    "conformsTo" : [
        "https://api.stacspec.org/v1.0.0-beta.5/core"
    ],
    "links": [
        {
            "rel": "self",
            "type": "application/json",
            "href": "https://stacserver.org"
        },
        {
            "rel": "root",
            "type": "application/json",
            "href": "https://stacserver.org"
        },
        {
            "rel": "service-desc",
            "type": "application/vnd.oai.openapi+json;version=3.0",
            "href": "https://stacserver.org/api"
        },
        {
            "rel": "service-doc",
            "type": "text/html",
            "href": "https://stacserver.org/api.html"
        },
        {
            "rel": "child",
            "type": "application/json",
            "href": "https://stacserver.org/collections/sentinel-2",
        },
        {
            "rel": "child",
            "type": "application/json",
            "href": "https://stacserver.org/collections/landsat-8",
        }
    ]
}
