  uses all the OGC API - Features openapi fragments to describe returning STAC Item objects.

## Overview

The *STAC API - Collections and Features* specification extends the
[OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core](https://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html)
(OAFeat) specification. OAFeat
allows returning any content type from its endpoints, whereas *STAC API - Features* requires support
for returning STAC [Item](../stac-spec/item-spec/README.md) and STAC [Collection](../stac-spec/item-spec/README.md)
entities. As these entities are also GeoJSON types, the GeoJSON conformance class of OGC API - Features is supported
(<http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-features-1/1.0/conf/geojson>).

## Conformance Classes

While OAFeat defines a single conformance class for its endpoints, STAC API divides these behaviors into two
conformance classes -- Collections and Features. The STAC API - Features
(<https://api.stacspec.org/v1.0.0-rc.2/ogcapi-features>) conformance class includes and extends the behavior
of OAFeat, while the STAC API - Collections (<https://api.stacspec.org/v1.0.0-rc.2/collections>) conformance
class is the subset of Features that pertains only to Collections.

### STAC API - Features

The *STAC API - Features* (<https://api.stacspec.org/v1.0.0-rc.2/ogcapi-features>) conformance class
encompasses all of the behavior described in this specification, as
derived from OAFeat.

### STAC API - Collections

The *STAC API - Collections* (<https://api.stacspec.org/v1.0.0-rc.2/collections>) conformance class
requires only the subset of the behavior of Features that relates to Collections.

This subset is:

- the `data` link relation on the landing page
- the `/collections` and `/collections/{collection_id}` endpoints

This subset of behavior is useful in conjunction
with the *STAC API - Item Search* conformance class to allow the description of STAC Collections
without needing to implement the entire *STAC API - Features* conformance class.

### OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core

A STAC API implementation that conforms to *STAC API - Features* (<https://api.stacspec.org/v1.0.0-rc.2/ogcapi-features>)
also conforms to
[OGC API - Features - Part 1 Requirements Class Core](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html#rc_core)
conformance class (<http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-features-1/1.0/conf/core>). 
This conformance class should be advertised to OAFeat clients so they will also work with the STAC API.

### OGC API - Features - Part 1: GeoJSON

A STAC API implementation that conforms to *STAC API - Features*
also conforms to [OGC API - Features - Part 1 Requirements Class GeoJSON](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html#_requirements_class_geojson) (<http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-features-1/1.0/conf/geojson>)
This conformance class should be advertised to OAFeat clients so they will know of the support for GeoJSON.

### OGC API - Features - Part 1: OpenAPI 3.0

If OpenAPI 3.0 is used for the endpoint referenced by the `service-desc` link relation in the landing page defined
by *STAC API - Core*, the
[OGC API - Features - Part 1 Requirements Class OpenAPI 3.0](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html#rc_oas30)
(<http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-features-1/1.0/conf/oas30>) can be advertised. 

## Link Relations

These conformance classes also requires implementation of the link relations in the [STAC API - Core](../core) conformance class.

While the STAC definition of Link does not require the `type` field, this is required by OAFeat,
and is thereby required by the *STAC API - Features* conformance class.
If the target of a Link's `type` is unknown, `type` SHOULD be set to `application/octet-stream` or `text/plain`.

### Landing Page (/)

The following Link relations must exist in the Landing Page (root).

| **rel**       | **href**       | **Media Type**   | **From** | **Description**     |
| ------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | -------- | ------------------- |
| `conformance` | `/conformance` | application/json | OAFeat   | Conformance URI     |
| `data`        | `/collections` | application/json | OAFeat   | List of Collections |

### Collections (/collections)

The following Link relations must exist in the `/collections` endpoint response.

| **rel** | **href**       | **Media Type**   | **From**                                    | **Description** |
| ------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `root`  | `/`            | application/json | STAC API - Features, STAC API - Collections | The root URI    |
| `self`  | `/collections` | application/json | OAFeat                                      | Self reference  |

### Collection (/collections/{collectionId})

The following Link relations must exist in the Collection object returned from the `/collections/{collectionId}` endpoint.

| **rel**  | **href**                      | **Media Type**   | **From**                                    | **Description**                            |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `root`   | `/`                           | application/json | STAC API - Features, STAC API - Collections | The root URI                               |
| `parent` | `/`                           | application/json | OAFeat                                      | Parent reference, usually the root Catalog |
| `self`   | `/collections/{collectionId}` | application/json | OAFeat                                      | Self reference                             |

Additionally, these relations may exist for the `/collections/{collectionId}` endpoint:

| **rel**     | **href** | **Media Type** | **From**        | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------- | -------- | -------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `canonical` | various  | various        | STAC API - Core | Provides the preferred paths to get to STAC Collection and Item objects, if they differ from the URL that was used to retrieve the STAC object and thus duplicate other content. This can be useful in federated catalogs that present metadata that has a different location than the source metadata. |

Usually, the `self` link in a Collection must link to the same URL that was used to request
it. However, implementations may choose to have the canonical location of the Collection be
elsewhere. If this is done, it is recommended to include a `rel` of `canonical` to that location.

Note that the `parent` link for a Collection should be point to the parent Catalog (such as the root Catalog, `/`) or Collection
of that Collection, rather than the API sub-path of `/collections`.

### Collection Items (/collections/{collectionId}/items)

The following Link relations must exist in the ItemCollection object returned from the `/collections/{collectionId}/items` endpoint.

| **rel**      | **href**                            | **Media Type**       | **From**            | **Description**      |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| `root`       | `/`                                 | application/json     | STAC API - Features | The root URI         |
| `self`       | `/collections/{collectionId}/items` | application/geo+json | OAFeat              | Self reference       |
| `collection` | `/collections/{collectionId}`       | application/json     | OAFeat              | Collection reference |

### Items (/collections/{collectionId}/items/{itemId})

The following Link relations must exist in the Item object returned from the `/collections/{collectionId}/items/{itemId}` endpoint.

| **rel**  | **href**                                     | **Media Type**       | **From**            | **Description**                                     |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `root`   | `/`                                          | application/json     | STAC API - Features | The root URI                                        |
| `parent` | `/collections/{collectionId}`                | application/json     | OAFeat              | Parent reference, usually the containing Collection |
| `self`   | `/collections/{collectionId}/items/{itemId}` | application/geo+json | OAFeat              | Self reference                                      |

Note that the `parent` link for an Item should point to the containing Collection
(e.g., `/collections/{collectionId}`), rather than the API sub-path
of `/collections/{collectionId}/items/`.

## Endpoints

This conformance class also requires for the endpoints in the [STAC API - Core](../core) conformance class to be implemented.

The *OGC API - Features* endpoints are shown below, with details provided in the OpenAPI specifications for [Features](openapi-features.yaml) or [Collections](openapi-collections.yaml).

| **Endpoint**                                    | **Returns**          | **Media Type**                                          | **Description**                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/collections`                                  | application/json     | JSON                                                    | Object containing an array of Collection objects in the Catalog, and Link relations |
| `/collections/{collectionId}`                   | application/json     | [Collection](../stac-spec/collection-spec/README.md)    | Returns single Collection JSON                                                      |
| `/collections/{collectionId}/items`             | application/geo+json | [ItemCollection](../fragments/itemcollection/README.md) | GeoJSON FeatureCollection-conformant entity of Item objects in collection           |
| `/collections/{collectionId}/items/{featureId}` | application/geo+json | [Item](../stac-spec/item-spec/README.md)                | Returns single Item (GeoJSON Feature)                                               |

The OGC API - Features is a standard API that represents collections of geospatial data. It defines a RESTful interface
to query geospatial data, with GeoJSON as a main return type. With OAFeat you can return any `Feature`, which is a geometry
plus any number of properties. The core [STAC Item spec](../stac-spec/item-spec/README.md)
enhances the core `Feature` with additional requirements and options to enable cataloging of spatiotemporal 'assets' like
satellite imagery.

OAFeat also defines the concept of a Collection, which contains Features. In OAFeat, a Collection is a set of data that can
be queried ([7.11](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html#_collections_)), and each describes basic
information about the geospatial dataset, like its name and description, as well as the spatial and temporal extents of all
the data contained. A [STAC Collection](../stac-spec/collection-spec/README.md) contains this same
information, along with other STAC-specific fields to provide additional metadata for searching spatiotemporal assets, and
thus are compliant with both OAFeat Collection and STAC Collection, and are returned from the `/collections/{collectionId}`
endpoint.

In OAFeat, Features are the individual records within a Collection and are usually provided in GeoJSON format.
[STAC Item](../stac-spec/item-spec/README.md) objects are compliant with the OAFeat Features
[GeoJSON requirements class](http://docs.ogc.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html#_requirements_class_geojson), and are returned from the
`/collections/{collectionId}/items/{itemId}` endpoint. The return of other encodings
([html](http://docs.ogc.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html#rc_html), [gml](http://docs.ogc.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html#rc_gmlsf0))
is outside the scope of STAC API, as the [STAC Item](../stac-spec/item-spec/item-spec.md) is
specified in GeoJSON.

A typical OAFeat will have multiple collections. Simple search for items within a collection can be done
with the resource endpoint `GET /collections/{collectionId}/items`. This endpoint must be exposed via a
link in the individual collection's endpoint with `rel=items`, as shown in the
[Example Landing Page diagram](../overview.md#example-landing-page). Note that this relation is `items`, which is
distinct from the `item` relation defined in STAC for linking to a single Item. The part of the API implementing OAFeat will usually not use
`item` relations directly, but instead rely on
the collection resource linking to a paginated endpoint returning items through a link relation
`items`, e.g., `/collections/{collectionId}` has a link with relation `items` linking
to `/collections/{collectionId}/items`. However, static catalogs and other parts of the API may contain `item` relations.

It is recommended to have each OAFeat Collection correspond to a STAC Collection,
and the `/collections/{collectionId}/items` endpoint can be used as a single collection search. Implementations may **optionally**
provide support for the full superset of STAC API query parameters to the `/collections/{collectionId}/items` endpoint,
where the collection ID in the path is equivalent to providing that single value in the `Collections* query parameter in
STAC API.

Implementing OAFeat enables a wider range of clients to access the API's STAC Item objects, as it is a more widely implemented
protocol than STAC.

## Item Pagination

OAFeat supports paging through hypermedia links for the Items resource
(`/collections/{collectionId}/items`). Since only GET requests are allowed for this endpoint,
it is possible
to provide a Link with `rel` type `next` and the href of the full URL of the next page of results.
This link href must contain any URL parameters that are necessary
for the implementation to understand how to provide the next page of results, e.g., the query parameters `page`, `next`,
or `token` and any additional filter parameters if given and required. For example, the links array will have an object like:

```json
    "links": [
        {
            "rel": "next",
            "type": "application/geo+json",
            "href": "https://stac-api.example.com/collections/my_collection/items?page=2"
        }
    ]
```

The href may contain any arbitrary URL parameter, which is implementation-specific:

- `https://stac-api.example.com/collections/my_collection/items?page=2`
- `https://stac-api.example.com/collections/my_collection/items?next=8a35eba9c`
- `https://stac-api.example.com/collections/my_collection/items?token=f32890a0bdb09ac3`

In addition to supporting query parameters in the URL value of the `href` field,
STAC has extended the Link object
with additional fields to support more complex HTTP requests. These include `method` to specify
an HTTP method GET or POST, `headers` to add HTTP headers in the request, and `body` with either
the entire body for the request or only the body fields that must be changed from the previous
request, as determined by the `merge` field. These fields are described in detail in the
[Item Search](../item-search/README.md#pagination) spec.

Implementations may also add link relations `prev`, `first`, and `last`. Most API implementations
should be able to support `first`, though `last` may be infeasible to implement in some data
stores.

See the [paging examples](../item-search/examples.md#paging-examples) for additional insight.

## Collection Pagination

OAFeat does not define a specific mechanism for how clients may access all collections from servers
with many
collections. STAC API - Features adds support for this with pagination (similar to the Item pagination
mechanism) through hypermedia links for the Collections resource
(`/collections`). This mechanism aligns with pagination of collections in the
[OGC API - Common - Part 2: Geospatial Data](https://portal.ogc.org/files/99149) specification. 
With this, a link with
relation `next` is included in the `links` array,
and this is used to navigate to the next page of Collection objects. The specific query
parameter used for paging is implementation specific and not defined by STAC API. For example,
an implementation may take a parameter (e.g., `page`) indicating the numeric page of results, a
base64-encoded value indicating the last result returned for the current page (e.g., `search_after` as
in Elasticsearch), or a cursor token representing backend state.

In our simple example of numerical pages, the response for `page=3` would have a
`links` array containing these two Links indicating the URLs for the next (page=4) and
previous (page=2) pages:

```json
{
    "links": [
    {
        "rel": "prev",
        "type": "application/json",
        "href": "https://stac-api.example.com/collections?page=2"
    },
    {
        "rel": "next",
        "type": "application/json",
        "href": "https://stac-api.example.com/collections?page=4"
    }
    ]
}
```

In addition to supporting query parameters in the URL value of the `href` field,
STAC has extended the Link object
with additional fields to support more complex HTTP requests. These include `method` to specify
an HTTP method GET or POST, `headers` to add HTTP headers in the request, and `body` with either
the entire body for the request or only the body fields that must be changed from the previous
request, as determined by the `merge` field. These fields are described in detail in the
[Item Search](../item-search/README.md#pagination) spec.

Implementations may also add link relations `prev`, `first`, and `last`. Most API implementations
should be able to support `first`, though `last` may be infeasible to implement in some data
stores.

## Examples

Note that the OAFeat endpoints *only* allow HTTP GET. HTTP POST requests are not supported. If POST is required,
it is recommended to use STAC Item Search, as it can be constrained to a single collection to act the same as
an OAFeat `items` endpoint.

Request all the data in `mycollection` that is in New Zealand:

```
GET /collections/mycollection/items?bbox=160.6,-55.95,-170,-25.89
```

Request 100 results in `mycollection` from New Zealand:

```
GET /collections/mycollection/items?bbox=160.6,-55.95,-170,-25.89&limit=100
```

Request all the data in `mycollection` that is in New Zealand at anytime on January 1st, 2019:

```
GET /collections/mycollection/items?bbox=160.6,-55.95,-170,-25.89&datetime=2019-01-01T00:00:00Z/2019-01-01T23:59:59Z
```

Request 10 results from the data in `mycollection` from between January 1st (inclusive) and April 1st, 2019 (exclusive):

```
GET /collections/mycollection/items?datetime=2019-01-01T00:00:00Z/2019-03-31T23:59:59Z&limit=10
```

## Example Landing Page

This JSON is what would be expected from an api that implements only *STAC API - Core* and 
*STAC API - Features*. In practice,
most APIs will also implement other conformance classes, and those will be reflected in the `links` and
`conformsTo` fields.  A more typical Landing Page example is in
the [overview](../overview.md#example-landing-page) document.

```json
{
    "stac_version": "1.0.0",
    "id": "example-stac",
    "title": "A simple STAC API Example",
    "description": "This Catalog aims to demonstrate the a simple landing page",

    ],
    "links": [
        {

        },
        {
            "rel": "root",
            "type": "application/json",
            "href": "https://stac-api.example.com"
        },
        {
            "rel": "conformance",
            "type": "application/json",
            "href": "https://stac-api.example.com/conformance"
        },
        {
            "rel": "service-desc",
            "type": "application/vnd.oai.openapi+json;version=3.0",
            "href": "https://stac-api.example.com/api"
        },
        {
            "rel": "service-doc",
            "type": "text/html",
            "href": "https://stac-api.example.com/api.html"
        },
        {
            "rel": "data",
            "type": "application/json",
            "href": "https://stac-api.example.com/collections"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Example Collection Endpoint

The landing page `data` relation points to an endpoint to retrieve all collections. Each collection then has
a link relation to its `items` resource through the link with a rel value `items`.  Note here that, unlike
as is typical with a static STAC Collection, there are no links here with rel value `item`.

`https://stac-api.example.com/collections/aster-l1t`

```json
{
  "id": "aster-l1t",
  "type": "Collection",
  "title": "ASTER L1T",
  "links": [
    {
      "rel": "items",
      "type": "application/geo+json",
      "href": "https://stac-api.example.com/collections/aster-l1t/items"
    },
    {
      "rel": "parent",
      "type": "application/json",
      "href": "https://stac-api.example.com"
    },
    {
      "rel": "root",
      "type": "application/json",
      "href": "https://stac-api.example.com"
    },
    {
      "rel": "self",
      "type": "application/json",
      "href": "https://stac-api.example.com/collections/aster-l1t"
    }
  ]
}
```
