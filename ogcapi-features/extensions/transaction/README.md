# STAC API - Transaction 

*based on [**OGC API - Features - Part 4: Simple Transactions**](https://www.ogc.org/standards/ogcapi-features)*

- **OpenAPI specification:** [openapi.yaml](openapi.yaml)
- **Conformance URIs:**
  - <https://api.stacspec.org/v1.0.0-beta.3/ogcapi-features/extensions/transaction>
  - <http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-features-4/1.0/conf/simpletx>
- **Extension [Maturity Classification](../../../extensions.md#extension-maturity):** Pilot
- **Dependencies**: [STAC API - Features](../../README.md)

The core STAC API doesn't support adding, editing, or removing items.
The transaction API extension supports the creation, editing, and deleting of items through POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests.

STAC Transactions are based on the [OGC API - Features](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/features/) transactions, as 
specified in [Part 4: Simple Transactions](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/DRAFTS/20-002.html). The core
OGC standard lays out the end points for transactions, without specifying any content types. For STAC we
use STAC Item objects in our transactions, and those transaction must be done at the OGC API - Features endpoints,
under `/collections/{collectionID}/items`. The OpenAPI document (specified as an OpenAPI fragment that 
gets build in the full STAC OpenAPI document) simply gives the STAC examples of using the
Simple Transactions API mechanism.

OGC API [Simple Transactions](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/DRAFTS/20-002.html) is still a draft standard, so 
once it is released STAC will align to a released one, but we anticipate few changes as it is a very simple document.

STAC Transactions additionally support optimistic locking through use of the ETag header, as specified in the
OpenAPI document. This is not currently specified in OGC API - Features, but it is compatible and we will 
work to get it incorporated.
