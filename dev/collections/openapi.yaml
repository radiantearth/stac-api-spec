            This is only valid when the server is responding to POST request.

            If merge is true, the client is expected to merge the body value
            into the current request body before following the link.
            This avoids passing large post bodies back and forth when following
            links, particularly for navigating pages through the `POST /search`
            endpoint.

            NOTE: To support form encoding it is expected that a client be able
            to merge in the key value pairs specified as JSON
            `{"next": "token"}` will become `&next=token`.

        extents, for example, thermal or pressure ranges.


        The first item in the array describes the overall extent of

        the data. All subsequent items describe more precise extents, 

        e.g., to identify clusters of data.

        Clients only interested in the overall extent will only need to

        access the first item in each array.

                The first bounding box describes the overall spatial

                extent of the data. All subsequent bounding boxes describe 

                more precise bounding boxes, e.g., to identify clusters of data.

                Clients only interested in the overall spatial extent will

                only need to access the first item in each array.

              items:
                description: >-
                  Each bounding box is provided as four or six numbers,
                  depending on

                  whether the coordinate reference system includes a vertical
                  axis

                  (height or depth):


                  * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1

                  * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 2

                  * Minimum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)

                  * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 1

                  * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2

                  * Maximum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)


                  The coordinate reference system of the values is WGS 84
                  longitude/latitude

                  (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84) unless a
                  different coordinate

                  reference system is specified in `crs`.


                  For WGS 84 longitude/latitude the values are in most cases the
                  sequence of

                  minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude and
                  maximum latitude.

                  However, in cases where the box spans the antimeridian the
                  first value

                  (west-most box edge) is larger than the third value (east-most
                  box edge).


                  If the vertical axis is included, the third and the sixth
                  number are

                  the bottom and the top of the 3-dimensional bounding box.


                  If a feature has multiple spatial geometry properties, it is
                  the decision of the

                  server whether only a single spatial geometry property is used
                  to determine

                  the extent or all relevant geometries.

              Roles of the provider.

              The provider's role(s) can be one or more of the following
              elements:

              * licensor: The organization that is licensing the dataset under
                the license specified in the collection's license field.
              * producer: The producer of the data is the provider that
                initially captured and processed the source data, e.g. ESA for
                Sentinel-2 data.
              * processor: A processor is any provider who processed data to a
                derived product.
              * host: The host is the actual provider offering the data on their
                storage. There should be no more than one host, specified as last
                element of the list.

            Summaries are either a unique set of all available values *or*
            statistics. Statistics by default only specify the range (minimum
            and maximum values), but can optionally be accompanied by additional
            statistical values. The range can specify the potential range of
            values, but it is recommended to be as precise as possible. The set
            of values must contain at least one element and it is strongly
            recommended to list all values. It is recommended to list as many
            properties as reasonable so that consumers get a full overview of
            the Collection. Properties that are covered by the Collection
            specification (e.g. `providers` and `license`) may not be repeated
            in the summaries.

                  By default, only ranges with a minimum and a maximum value can
                  be specified. Ranges can be specified for ordinal values only,
                  which means they need to have a rank order. Therefore, ranges
                  can only be specified for numbers and some special types of
                  strings. Examples: grades (A to F), dates or times.
                  Implementors are free to add other derived statistical values
                  to the object, for example `mean` or `stddev`.

        classes it implements and conforms to.

        The feature collections shared by this API.


        The dataset is organized as one or more feature collections. This
        resource

        provides information about and access to the collections.


        The response contains the list of collections. For each collection, a
        link

        to the items in the collection (path
        `/collections/{collectionId}/items`,

        link relation `items`) as well as key information about the collection.

        This information includes:


        * A local identifier for the collection that is unique for the dataset;

        * A list of coordinate reference systems (CRS) in which geometries may
        be returned by the server. The first CRS is the default coordinate
        reference system (the default is always WGS 84 with axis order
        longitude/latitude);

        * An optional title and description for the collection;

        * An optional extent that can be used to provide an indication of the
        spatial and temporal extent of the collection - typically derived from
        the data;

        * An optional indicator about the type of the items in the collection
        (the default value, if the indicator is not provided, is 'feature').
