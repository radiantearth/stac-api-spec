      name: bbox
      in: query
      description: >-
        Only features that have a geometry that intersects the bounding box are
        selected.

        The bounding box is provided as four or six numbers, depending on
        whether the

        coordinate reference system includes a vertical axis (height or depth):


        * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1

        * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 2

        * Minimum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)

        * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 1

        * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2

        * Maximum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)


        The coordinate reference system of the values is WGS 84
        longitude/latitude

        (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84).


        For WGS 84 longitude/latitude the values are in most cases the sequence
        of

        minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude and maximum
        latitude.

        However, in cases where the box spans the antimeridian the first value

        (west-most box edge) is larger than the third value (east-most box
        edge).


        If the vertical axis is included, the third and the sixth number are

        the bottom and the top of the 3-dimensional bounding box.


        If a feature has multiple spatial geometry properties, it is the
        decision of the

        server whether only a single spatial geometry property is used to
        determine

        the extent or all relevant geometries.

        Only features that have a temporal property that intersects the value of

        `datetime` are selected.


        If a feature has multiple temporal properties, it is the decision of the

            links, particularly for navigating pages through the `POST /search`

                  Each bounding box is provided as four or six numbers,
                  depending on

                  whether the coordinate reference system includes a vertical
                  axis

                  (height or depth):


                  * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1

                  * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 2

                  * Minimum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)

                  * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 1

                  * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2

                  * Maximum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)


                  The coordinate reference system of the values is WGS 84
                  longitude/latitude

                  (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84) unless a
                  different coordinate

                  reference system is specified in `crs`.


                  For WGS 84 longitude/latitude the values are in most cases the
                  sequence of

                  minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude and
                  maximum latitude.

                  However, in cases where the box spans the antimeridian the
                  first value

                  (west-most box edge) is larger than the third value (east-most
                  box edge).


                  If the vertical axis is included, the third and the sixth
                  number are

                  the bottom and the top of the 3-dimensional bounding box.


                  If a feature has multiple spatial geometry properties, it is
                  the decision of the

                  server whether only a single spatial geometry property is used
                  to determine

                  the extent or all relevant geometries.

            Summaries are either a unique set of all available values *or*

            and maximum values), but can optionally be accompanied by additional
            statistical values. The range can specify the potential range of
            values, but it is recommended to be as precise as possible. The set
            of values must contain at least one element and it is strongly
            recommended to list all values. It is recommended to list as many
            properties as reasonable so that consumers get a full overview of
            the Collection. Properties that are covered by the Collection
            specification (e.g. `providers` and `license`) may not be repeated
            in the summaries.

      description: |-
        Only features that have a geometry that intersects the bounding box are
        selected. The bounding box is provided as four or six numbers,
        depending on whether the coordinate reference system includes a
        vertical axis (elevation or depth):

        * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1
        * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 2  
        * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 3 (optional) 
        * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 1 
        * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2 
        * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 3 (optional)

        The coordinate reference system of the values is WGS84
        longitude/latitude (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84).

        For WGS84 longitude/latitude the values are in most cases the sequence
        of minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude and maximum
        latitude. However, in cases where the box spans the antimeridian the
        first value (west-most box edge) is larger than the third value
        (east-most box edge).

        If a feature has multiple spatial geometry properties, it is the
        decision of the server whether only a single spatial geometry property
        is used to determine the extent or all relevant geometries.

        Example: The bounding box of the New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone in
        WGS 84 (from 160.6°E to 170°W and from 55.95°S to 25.89°S) would be
        represented in JSON as `[160.6, -55.95, -170, -25.89]` and in a query as
        `bbox=160.6,-55.95,-170,-25.89`.

        The URIs of all conformance classes supported by the server.

        To support "generic" clients that want to access multiple
        OGC API Features implementations - and not "just" a specific
        API / server, the server declares the conformance
        classes it implements and conforms to.

    Collections:
      description: >-
        The feature collections shared by this API.


        The dataset is organized as one or more feature collections. This
        resource

        provides information about and access to the collections.


        The response contains the list of collections. For each collection, a
        link

        to the items in the collection (path
        `/collections/{collectionId}/items`,

        link relation `items`) as well as key information about the collection.

        This information includes:


        * A local identifier for the collection that is unique for the dataset;

        * A list of coordinate reference systems (CRS) in which geometries may
        be returned by the server. The first CRS is the default coordinate
        reference system (the default is always WGS 84 with axis order
        longitude/latitude);

        * An optional title and description for the collection;

        * An optional extent that can be used to provide an indication of the
        spatial and temporal extent of the collection - typically derived from
        the data;

        * An optional indicator about the type of the items in the collection
        (the default value, if the indicator is not provided, is 'feature').

    Features:
      description: >-
        The response is a document consisting of features in the collection.

        The features included in the response are determined by the server

        based on the query parameters of the request. To support access to

        larger collections without overloading the client, the API supports

        paged access with links to the next page, if more features are selected

        that the page size.


        The `bbox` and `datetime` parameter can be used to select only a

        subset of the features in the collection (the features that are in the

        bounding box or time interval). The `bbox` parameter matches all
        features

        in the collection that are not associated with a location, too. The

        `datetime` parameter matches all features in the collection that are

        not associated with a time stamp or interval, too.


        The `limit` parameter may be used to control the subset of the

        selected features that should be returned in the response, the page
        size.

        Each page may include information about the number of selected and

        returned features (`numberMatched` and `numberReturned`) as well as

        links to support paging (link relation `next`).
