        This method is optional, but you MUST implement `POST /search` if you
        want to implement this method.

        If this endpoint is implemented on a server, it is required to add a
        link referring to this endpoint with `rel` set to `search` to the
        `links` array in `GET /`. As `GET` is the default method, the `method`
        may not be set explicitly in the link.

        This method is mandatory to implement if `GET /search` is implemented.
        If this endpoint is implemented on a server, it is required to add a
        link referring to this endpoint with `rel` set to `search` and `method`
        set to `POST` to the `links` array in `GET /`.

        Either a date-time or an interval, open or closed. Date and time expressions
        adhere to RFC 3339. Open intervals are expressed using double-dots.

        Examples:

        * A date-time: "2018-02-12T23:20:50Z"
        * A closed interval: "2018-02-12T00:00:00Z/2018-03-18T12:31:12Z"
        * Open intervals: "2018-02-12T00:00:00Z/.." or "../2018-03-18T12:31:12Z"

        Only features that have a temporal property that intersects the value of
        `datetime` are selected.

        If a feature has multiple temporal properties, it is the decision of the
        server whether only a single temporal property is used to determine
        the extent or all relevant temporal properties.

    bbox:
      name: bbox
      in: query
      description: |-
        Only features that have a geometry that intersects the bounding box are selected.
        The bounding box is provided as four or six numbers, depending on
        whether the coordinate reference system includes a vertical axis (height
        or depth):

        * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1
        * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 2
        * Minimum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)
        * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 1
        * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2
        * Maximum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)

        The coordinate reference system of the values is WGS 84
        longitude/latitude (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84).

        For WGS 84 longitude/latitude the values are in most cases the sequence
        of minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude and maximum
        latitude. However, in cases where the box spans the antimeridian the
        first value (west-most box edge) is larger than the third value
        (east-most box edge).

        If the vertical axis is included, the third and the sixth number are
        the bottom and the top of the 3-dimensional bounding box.

        If a feature has multiple spatial geometry properties, it is the
        decision of the server whether only a single spatial geometry property
        is used to determine the extent or all relevant geometries.

        Example: The bounding box of the New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone in
        WGS 84 (from 160.6°E to 170°W and from 55.95°S to 25.89°S) would be
        represented in JSON as `[160.6, -55.95, -170, -25.89]` and in a query as
        `bbox=160.6,-55.95,-170,-25.89`.
