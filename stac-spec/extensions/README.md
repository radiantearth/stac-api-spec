## Overview

One of the most important aspects of the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog specification is its extensibility. The core
STAC specification defines only a minimal core, but is designed for extension. It is expected that most real-world
implementations will use several 'extensions' to fully describe their data. This document describes how extensions
work, and links to the 'core' extensions included in this repo, as well as to a variety of 'community' extensions.

**For the complete list of available extensions see the [STAC extensions overview page](https://stac-extensions.github.io/).**

Extensions to the core STAC specification provide additional JSON fields that can be used to better describe
the data. Most tend to be about describing a particular domain or type of data, but some imply
functionality.

Extensions include a JSON Schema precisely describing the structure, a natural language description of the fields, and thorough examples.

Anybody can create an extension for their data, and data providers often work together to share
fields between them to create a shared community extensions. See the section below on '[Extending STAC](#extending-stac)')
for information on how to get started. And everyone is encouraged to link to the extension in the table below, so others
can be aware of it.

Each extension has at least one *owner*. You can find extension owners in each extension's README.

## Using Extensions

When deciding how to model data in STAC it is highly recommended to first look at the [list of 
extensions](https://stac-extensions.github.io/) and re-use fields there instead of creating your own version. This
increases interoperability, as users know that the meaning of your fields is the same as in other STAC 
implementations. Many clients will also understand more mature extensions for better display and querying. 

To incorporate an extension in STAC the 'extension ID' of the extension must be added to the `stac_extensions`
array of the STAC [Catalog](../catalog-spec/catalog-spec.md#stac_extensions), 
[Collection](../collection-spec/collection-spec.md#stac_extensions) or [Item](../item-spec/item-spec.md#stac_extensions)
object. This identifier is a link to the JSON Schema URL that validates the fields in the extension, so STAC validators
can fetch the Schema to validate that the STAC object properly follows the extension. These JSON Schema URLs also act as 
identifiers for specific version of the extension that the STAC object implements. The extension ID can be
found listed as the 'identifier' in the second line of the README of any extension made with the [extension 
template](https://github.com/stac-extensions/template), and new ones get published automatically with any release made 
with the template.

### Extension IDs in `stac_extensions`

The logic for when an object should list an extension ID in its `stac_extension` array is as follows:

- If the object directly implements the extension (by following the specified requirements - usually by including 
fields, but occasionally implementing alternate behaviors), the  `stac_extensions` of that object should contain the extension ID.
- If an Asset implements fields of the extension, then `stac_extensions` of the Item or Collection which holds that
  Asset should contain the extension ID.
- If a Collection [summary](../collection-spec/collection-spec.md#summaries) contains Item fields that implement an extension, then
  the `stac_extensions` array of that Collection should list the extension ID. For example, if a Collection `summaries` field
  contains a summary of `eo:bands`, then that Collection should have the EO extension JSON Schema URL in the `stac_extensions` array.
- If an object implements an extension that results in fields from a separate extension to be referenced, then the latter extension
  ID should be included in the `stac_extensions` array for that object. For example, if a Collection implements the
  [item_assets](https://github.com/stac-extensions/item-assets) extension, and in the `item_assets` field there is an Asset Definition
  which includes `eo:bands`, then the EO extension ID should be listed in that Collection's `stac_extensions`.

## Stable STAC Extensions

These extensions are considered stable and are widely used in many production implementations. As additional extensions advance
through the [Extension Maturity](#extension-maturity) classification they, will be added here.

| Extension Title                                                       |     Description                |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| [Electro-Optical](https://github.com/stac-extensions/eo/)             | Covers electro-optical data that represents a snapshot of the Earth for a single date and time. It could consist of multiple spectral bands, for example visible bands, infrared bands, red edge bands and panchromatic bands. The extension provides common fields like bands, cloud cover, gsd and more. |
| [Projection](https://github.com/stac-extensions/projection/)          | Provides a way to describe Items whose assets are in a geospatial projection. |
| [Scientific Citation](https://github.com/stac-extensions/scientific/) | Metadata that indicate from which publication data originates and how the data itself should be cited or referenced.  |
| [View Geometry](https://github.com/stac-extensions/view/)             | View Geometry adds metadata related to angles of sensors and other radiance angles that affect the view of resulting data |

## Community Extensions

There are many more extensions that are part of the broader STAC ecosystem. The center of activity for these is the
[stac-extensions GitHub organization](https://github.com/stac-extensions), which has a number of extension repositories. For 
an overview of all extensions with their [Extension Maturity](#extension-maturity) classification see the 
[STAC extensions overview page](https://stac-extensions.github.io/).

### Proposed extensions

Beyond the community extensions there have been a number of extensions that people have proposed to the STAC community. These
can be found in the STAC [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/issues) under the 
[new extension](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22new+extension%22) label.
These are ideas that others would likely use and potentially collaborate on. Anyone is free to add new
ideas there, and see the section below on [proposing new extensions](#proposing-new-extensions) for the
workflow to advance ideas into full-fledged community extensions.

## Extending STAC

Anyone is welcome to create an extension. There are several types of extensions, some just add additional fields,
some change the behavior of STAC and some introduce completely new functionality. New extensions should try to align
with existing extensions as well as possible and may even re-use fields and their definitions until they may get split
into a new extension that combines commonly used fields across multiple extensions.
Best practices for extension proposals are still emerging in this section.

### General Conventions

Creating a new extension usually involves defining a set of logically grouped fields, and specifying what the allowed values
for those fields are. This should be done in the extension text and in JSON Schema, to provide validation. While one 
can theoretically add fields anywhere in JSON there are some conventions as to where to add them in STAC objects.

1. Additional attributes relating to an [Item](../item-spec/item-spec.md) should be added into the Item Properties object,
   rather than directly in the Item object.
2. In general, additional attributes that apply to an Item Asset should also be allowed in Item Properties and vice-versa.
   For example, the `eo:bands` attribute may be used in Item Properties to describe the aggregation of all bands available in
   the Item Asset objects contained in the Item, but may also be used in an individual Item Asset to describe only the bands available in that asset.
3. Additional attributes relating to a [Catalog](../catalog-spec/catalog-spec.md) or
   [Collection](../collection-spec/collection-spec.md) should be added to the root of the object.
4. Extensions may also extend other extensions, declaring that dependency in the text and JSON Schema.

### Proposing new extensions

Extensions can be hosted anywhere, but should use the
[extension template](https://github.com/stac-extensions/stac-extensions.github.io#using-the-stac-extensions-template) 
as a starting point. If you'd like to add a repository to the [stac-extensions](https://github.com/stac-extensions) 
GitHub organization, just ask on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/SpatioTemporal-Asset-Catalog/Lobby)! This is fine for 
work-in-progress extensions. You can also host the extension repository in your own GitHub account, and optionally 
transfer it to the stac-extensions org later.

For new extensions that require community discussion, we recommend the following workflow:

- Use the stac-extensions template to sketch out your proposed extension
- Open an issue on this repository with the prefix "New Extension: " and describe the extension. Include a link to the extension repository.
- Discussion can occur on that issue, or discussion can move to issues/pull requests on the extension repository directly.
- Once the extension has an initial release, the issue on stac-spec will be closed.

### Extension Maturity

There are many extensions being built with STAC, but they have varying degrees of maturity. All community extensions
listed here included must include a maturity classification, so that STAC spec users can easily get a sense of how
much they can count on the extension. Extension creators are encouraged to list their extensions here, even if it is just
an rough proposal, so others can potentially collaborate.

| Maturity Classification |  Min Impl # | Description | Stability |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------- |
| Proposal                | 0           | An idea put forward by a community member to gather feedback | Not stable - breaking changes almost guaranteed as implementers try out the idea. |
| Pilot                   | 1           | Idea is fleshed out, with examples and a JSON schema, and implemented in one or more catalogs. Additional implementations encouraged to help give feedback | Approaching stability - breaking changes are not anticipated but can easily come from additional feedback |
| Candidate               | 3           | A number of implementers are using it and are standing behind it as a solid extension. Can generally count on an extension at this maturity level | Mostly stable, breaking changes require a new version and minor changes are unlikely. The extension has a code owner, designated in its README. |
| Stable                  | 6           | Highest current level of maturity. The community of extension maintainers commits to a STAC review process for any changes, which are not made lightly. | Completely stable, all changes require a new version number and review process. |
| Deprecated              | N/A         | A previous extension that has likely been superseded by a newer one or did not work out for some reason. | DO NOT USE, is not supported |

Maturity mostly comes through diverse implementations, so the minimum number of implementations
column is the main gating function for an extension to mature. But extension authors can also
choose to hold back the maturity advancement if they don't feel they are yet ready to commit to
the less breaking changes of the next level.

A 'mature' classification level will likely be added once there are extensions that have been
stable for over a year and are used in twenty or more implementations.

### Prefixes

A STAC Item can combine schema information from several different sources - the core STAC Item information,
an earth observation community extension, and a vendor specific provider. It can be difficult to distinguish exactly where each definition
came from, and to pull out the most relevant information, especially when vendors often will dump in all the metadata they have in to the
STAC definition.

So one idea is to have prefixes to differentiate specific vendors (like `dg:` for DigitalGlobe), and for communities of practice
(like `eo:` for Electro-Optical). These wouldn't be full namespacing, though an extension for like JSON-LD could potentially
evolve to make fully resolved namespacing an option.

An example of this can be seen in a Landsat example:

```js
  "properties": {
    "datetime":"2018-01-01T13:21:30Z",

    "start_datetime":"2018-01-01T13:21:30Z",
    "end_datetime":"2018-01-01T13:31:30Z",

    "view:off_nadir": -0.001,
    "eo:cloud_cover": 10.31,
    "view:sun_azimuth": 149.01607154,
    "view:sun_elevation": 59.21424700,
    "gsd": 30,

    "l8:data_type": "L1T",
    "l8:wrs_path": 153,
    "l8:wrs_row": 25,
    "l8:earth_sun_distance": 1.0141560,
    "l8:ground_control_points_verify": 114,
    "l8:geometric_rmse_model": 7.562,
    "l8:image_quality_tirs": 9,
    "l8:ground_control_points_model": 313,
    "l8:geometric_rmse_model_x": 5.96,
    "l8:geometric_rmse_model_y": 4.654,
    "l8:geometric_rmse_verify": 5.364,
    "l8:image_quality_oli": 9
  }
```

### Use of arrays and objects

For extensions, it is recommended to

1. Use arrays only as enumerations/lists (possibly sorted), without implying additional meaning (such as order)
2. To avoid using nested objects, in favor of multiple attributes with a similar naming scheme.

For example, if one would like to define an extension to contain a start and a end date,
there are multiple options (tl;dr: option **3** is recommended):

1. Define an object, for example: `"date_range": {"start": "2018-01-01", "end": "2018-01-31"}`.
   This is **discouraged** as it is more complex to search in objects.
2. Define an two-element array where the first element is the start date and the second element is the end date,
   for example `"date_range": ["2018-01-01", "2018-01-31"]`.
   This is **discouraged** as it would conflict with Collection `summaries`,
   which always considers arrays as true (potentially sorted) enumeration without any additional meaning.
3. Define two separate fields, e.g. `"date_range_start": "2018-01-01", "date_range_end": "2018-01-31"`.
   This is **recommended** as it avoids the conflicts above and is usually better displayed in software that only understands GeoJSON
   but has no clue about STAC.
   This is due to the fact that most legacy software can not display arrays or objects GeoJSON `properties` properly.

This rules only applies to the fields defined directly for the Item's `properties`.
For fields and structures defined on other levels (e.g. in the root of an Item or in an array), extension authors can freely define the structure.
So an array of objects such as the `eo:bands` are fine to use, but keep in mind that the drawbacks mentioned above usually still apply.
