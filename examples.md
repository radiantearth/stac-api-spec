# STAC API Examples

## OGC API - Features (OAFeat)

Note that the OAFeat endpoints *only* supports HTTP GET. HTTP POST requests are not supported.

Request all the data in `mycollection` that is in New Zealand:

```http
GET /collections/mycollection/items?bbox=160.6,-55.95,-170,-25.89
```

Request 100 results in `mycollection` from New Zealand:

```http
GET /collections/mycollection/items?bbox=160.6,-55.95,-170,-25.89&limit=100
```

Request all the data in `mycollection` that is in New Zealand at anytime on January 1st, 2019:

```http
GET /collections/mycollection/items?bbox=160.6,-55.95,-170,-25.89&datetime=2019-01-01T00:00:00Z/2019-01-01T23:59:59Z
```

Request 10 results from the data in `mycollection` from between January 1st (inclusive) and April 1st, 2019 (exclusive):

```http
GET /collections/mycollection/items?datetime=2019-01-01T00:00:00Z/2019-03-31T23:59:59Z&limit=10
```

## STAC API

The STAC API `/search/` endpoint can support the same requests as above, as POST.

Request 100 results in `mycollection` that is in New Zealand at anytime on January 1st, 2019:

```json
{
    "collections": ["mycollection"],
    "bbox": [160.6,-55.95,-170,-25.89],
    "limit": 100,
    "datetime": "2019-01-01T00:00:00Z/2019-01-01T23:59:59Z"
}
```

Use the *[Query](extensions/query/README.md)* extension to search for any data falling within a specific geometry 
collected between Jan 1st and May 1st, 2019:

Request to `POST /search`:
```json
{
    "limit": 100,
    "intersects": {
        "type": "Polygon",
        "coordinates": [[
            [-77.0824, 38.7886], [-77.0189, 38.7886],
            [-77.0189, 38.8351], [-77.0824, 38.8351],
            [-77.0824, 38.7886]
        ]]
    },
    "datetime": "2019-01-01/2019-05-01"
}
```

### Paging

#### Simple GET based search
Request:
```http
HTTP GET /search?bbox=-110,39.5,-105,40.5
```

Response with `200 OK`:
```json
{
    "type": "FeatureCollection",
    "features": [],
    "links": [
        {
            "rel": "next",
            "href": "http://api.cool-sat.com/search?page=2"
        }
    ]
}
```
Following the link `http://api.cool-sat.com/search?page=2` will send the user to the next page of results.

#### POST search with body and merge fields
Request to `HTTP POST /search`:
```json
{
    "bbox": [-110, 39.5, -105, 40.5]
}
```

Response with `200 OK`:
```json
{
    "type": "FeatureCollection",
    "features": [],
    "links": [
        {
            "rel": "next",
            "href": "http://api.cool-sat.com/search",
            "method": "POST",
            "body": {
                "page": 2,
                "limit": 10
            },
            "merge": true
        }
    ]
}
```

This tells the client to POST to the search endpoint using the original request with the `page` and `limit` fields 
merged in to obtain the next set of results:

Request to `POST /search`:
```json
{
    "bbox": [-110, 39.5, -105, 40.5],
    "page": 2,
    "limit": 10
}
```

This can be even more effective when using continuation tokens on the server, as the entire request body need not be 
repeated in the subsequent request:

Response with `200 OK`:
```json
{
    "rel": "next",
    "href": "http://api.cool-sat.com/search",
    "method": "POST",
    "body": {
        "next": "a9f3kfbc98e29a0da23"
    }
}
```
The above link tells the client not to merge (default of false) so it is only required to pass the next token in the body.

Request to `POST /search`:
```json
{
    "next": "a9f3kfbc98e29a0da23"
}
```

#### POST search using headers
Request to `HTTP POST /search`:
```json
{
    "bbox": [-110, 39.5, -105, 40.5],
    "page": 2,
    "limit": 10
}
```

Response with `200 OK`:
```json
{
    "type": "FeatureCollection",
    "features": [],
    "links": [
        {
            "rel": "next",
            "href": "http://api.cool-sat.com/search",
            "method": "POST",
            "headers": {
                "Search-After": "LC81530752019135LGN00"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

This tells the client to POST to the search endpoint with the header `Search-After` to obtain the next set of results:

Request:
```http
POST /search
Search-After: LC81530752019135LGN00
```
